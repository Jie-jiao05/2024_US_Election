### Explanation of Components

- **Response variable \( y_i \)**: Observed polling percentage for each poll \( i \). This represents the percentage of voter support.
- **Mean structure \( \mu_i \)**: Consists of four components:
  - **Intercept \( \alpha \)**: Represents the baseline average percentage across all polls.
  - **Spline component \( f(\text{end\_date\_num}_i) \)**: Captures temporal trends in polling percentages over time, modeled using a B-spline basis expansion. This allows the trend to adjust flexibly over time, fitting the non-linear trends typically observed in polling data.
  - **Pollster effect \( \text{pollster}_i \)**: A fixed effect to account for systematic differences across pollsters. Due to varying methodologies and sampling practices, some pollsters may produce consistently higher or lower estimates.
  - **State effect \( \text{state}_i \)**: A fixed effect accounting for differences across states. Given the diversity in political landscapes across U.S. states, this term allows for state-specific adjustments, capturing the influence of state-level variability on polling trends. For example, large or politically heterogeneous states may exhibit unique polling behaviors that could impact results.

Why does this look bad in my markdown?


The formatting in Markdown may look off if your elements aren't correctly marked as inline math, block math, or if they don’t have proper line breaks. Here are some tips to make it look good in Markdown:

1. **Inline Math**: Use single dollar signs (`$ ... $`) for inline math.
2. **Block Math**: Use double dollar signs (`$$ ... $$`) or separate it with new lines and indentations if it's a more complex structure.
3. **Line Breaks**: Add two spaces at the end of a line to force a line break in Markdown. 

Here’s how you can format your explanation more clearly:

Each math component will render correctly in Markdown as long as the syntax is consistent, and the indentations or bullet points help make each line read clearly. 

If you are rendering Markdown in a platform that supports LaTeX directly (like some Jupyter environments), you can also try LaTeX environments directly in Markdown using `$$` for multiline blocks.

# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the rstanarm package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from rstanarm.

# Model

The goal of our modeling strategy is twofold. Firstly, we aim to estimate the relationship between time (in days since the earliest poll) and the percentage polling of each political party (Democratic and Republican). Secondly, we want to assess the variation in these trends across different pollsters, accounting for temporal trends and other poll-specific factors. 

Here, we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model employed to investigate these relationships. Background details and model diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model Set-up

Let \( y_i \) denote the number of seconds a plane remained aloft. For our purposes, we define \( \beta_i \) as the wing width and \( \gamma_i \) as the wing length, both measured in millimeters.

\[
\begin{align} 
y_i | \mu_i, \sigma &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \text{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}
\]

In this model, we define \( \alpha \) as the intercept and apply priors to the parameters based on normal distributions with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 2.5. The model is fitted in R using the `rstanarm` package [@citeR] with default priors.

## Data Preparation and Transformations

The analysis dataset is filtered to separate Democratic (`dem_data`) and Republican (`rep_data`) poll data. We account for missing values by imputing "National" for missing states and convert end dates to a numerical count, representing the days since the earliest poll, for each party.

```r
dem_data <- data |>
  filter(party == "DEM") |>
  mutate(
    state = if_else(is.na(state), "National", state),
    end_date = mdy(end_date),
    num_dem = round((pct / 100) * sample_size, 0)
  )

rep_data <- data |>
  filter(party == "REP") |>
  mutate(
    state = if_else(is.na(state), "National", state),
    end_date = mdy(end_date),
    num_rep = round((pct / 100) * sample_size, 0)
  )
```

Pollster and state were converted to factors, while dates were converted to the number of days since the earliest poll:

```r
dem_data <- dem_data |>
  mutate(end_date_num = as.numeric(end_date - min(end_date)))
rep_data <- rep_data |>
  mutate(end_date_num = as.numeric(end_date - min(end_date)))
```

## Bayesian Model Fitting

We employed a Bayesian model with splines to fit a temporal trend for each party's polling percentage, including `pollster` as a fixed effect. Using `stan_glm` from the `rstanarm` package, the model was configured with a spline (`ns`) term on `end_date_num`, allowing for flexible curve fitting over time.

```r
spline_model <- stan_glm(
  pct ~ ns(end_date_num, df = 5) + pollster,
  data = dem_data,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = normal(0, 5),
  prior_intercept = normal(50, 10),
  seed = 1234,
  iter = 2000,
  chains = 4,
  refresh = 0
)

rep_spline_model <- stan_glm(
  pct ~ ns(end_date_num, df = 5) + pollster,
  data = rep_data,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = normal(0, 5),
  prior_intercept = normal(50, 10),
  seed = 1234,
  iter = 2000,
  chains = 4,
  refresh = 0
)
```

The spline's degrees of freedom (df) controls the curve's "wiggliness"; we chose `df = 5` to balance flexibility with model stability.

## Posterior Predictive Checks and Model Evaluation

Posterior predictive checks were performed to assess the model’s fit to observed data.

```r
pp_check(spline_model)
pp_check(rep_spline_model)
```

## Predictions and Visualization

We created a new dataset with `end_date_num` spanning the range of observed dates and used this to generate posterior predictions for both models. These predictions were summarized and plotted with confidence intervals.

```r
pred_summary <- new_data |>
  mutate(
    pred_mean = colMeans(posterior_preds),
    pred_lower = apply(posterior_preds, 2, quantile, probs = 0.025),
    pred_upper = apply(posterior_preds, 2, quantile, probs = 0.975)
  )

ggplot(dem_data, aes(x = end_date_num, y = pct, color = pollster)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(data = pred_summary, aes(x = end_date_num, y = pred_mean), color = "blue") +
  geom_ribbon(data = pred_summary, aes(x = end_date_num, ymin = pred_lower, ymax = pred_upper), alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "Days since earliest poll", y = "Percentage", title = "Poll Percentage over Time with Spline Fit") +
  theme_minimal()
```

To compare predictions between Democratic and Republican polls, we combined data for both parties and plotted their trends.

```r
ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = end_date_num, y = pct, color = party)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = pollster)) +
  geom_line(data = pred_summary_combined, aes(x = end_date_num, y = pred_mean, color = party)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = pred_summary_combined, aes(x = end_date_num, ymin = pred_lower, ymax = pred_upper, fill = party), alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "Days since earliest poll", y = "Percentage", title = "Poll Percentage over Time with Spline Fit") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

This visualization presents the Bayesian model predictions for each party, accounting for pollster-specific variations over time. The spline trend line provides a smoothed interpretation of polling trends, highlighting changes in party support across the polling period.

Make a version called time_series_summary stats, which plots their average support per month over time


CHAT:
To create a time series summary that shows average support per month for each party, you can modify the code to aggregate the data by month and year, then calculate the monthly average support for `DEM` and `REP`. Finally, we'll use `ggplot2` to create a time series plot of the average support over time.

Here’s how to do it:

```{r}
#| label: time_series_summary_stats
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

# Create a new summary dataset with average support per month
time_series_summary_stats <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(month = floor_date(end_date, "month")) %>%
  group_by(month, party) %>%
  summarise(avg_pct = round(mean(pct, na.rm = TRUE), 3), .groups = "drop") %>%
  filter(party %in% c("DEM", "REP"))

# Plot the time series of average support over time
ggplot(time_series_summary_stats, aes(x = month, y = avg_pct, color = party)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Average Monthly Support for DEM and REP Over Time",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Average % Support",
    color = "Party"
  ) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y-%m", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Grouping by Month and Party:** `floor_date(end_date, "month")` from the `lubridate` package creates a monthly grouping, and `group_by(month, party)` aggregates the data by both month and party.
2. **Calculating Monthly Average Support:** The `summarise()` function computes the average support (`avg_pct`) for each month and party.
3. **Plotting the Time Series:** `ggplot2` is used to create a line plot with `geom_line()` and `geom_point()` to illustrate the trend over time. Each line color represents a party (DEM or REP).
4. **Date Formatting:** `scale_x_date()` adjusts the x-axis to show month labels and sets a monthly interval.

This code will yield a clear and visually appealing time series plot of average monthly support for each party over the given time period.

Put these side-by-side


CHAT:

To display these two plots side-by-side in an R Markdown document, you can leverage the `{layout-ncol: 2}` option you've used in the chunk headers. This setting will arrange the two figures in a two-column layout, displaying them side-by-side as intended.

The code you've provided should work effectively in this format if each chunk is correctly processed by your R environment in the R Markdown document. Here's a refined layout if needed:

```markdown
## Comparing Models: Democrats vs. Republicans

The following figures compare the posterior predictive checks for the Democrats and Republicans models against their respective priors.

```{r fig-ppcheckandposteriorvsprior, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, layout-ncol=2, fig.cap="Examining how different the Democrats model is to the prior"}
pp_check(spline_model) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

```{r fig-ppcheckandposteriorvsprior_rep, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, layout-ncol=2, fig.cap="Examining how different the Republican model is to the prior"}
pp_check(rep_spline_model) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

This will produce two figures side-by-side, with each figure labeled according to the captions you specified.

If you encounter issues with layout rendering, consider wrapping both figures in a single chunk:

```markdown
```{r combined_pp_check, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, layout-ncol=2}
# Democrats model
plot1 <- pp_check(spline_model) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# Republicans model
plot2 <- pp_check(rep_spline_model) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol = 2)
```

This combined approach provides control over the display layout by arranging both plots manually within the same R chunk.

# Overview

We use R [@citeR] and Python [@citePython] to analyze a panel of poll data from Project FiveThirtyEight [@538]. It consists of voter support data from major pollsters in the US, with national and state-level polls. The data includes labels for pollster robustness as constructed by FiveThirtyEight. Polling date data is included, which gives us snapshots of the progressing state of the general election.

Our analysis is focused on determining whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will win the election. We drop all other candidates and parties on the belief that they are not likely to win given how close the race is between the two leading candidates.

For every observation in our data we have percentage of voter support, state, start and end dates of the poll, pollster quality, and party.

## Measurement
	
Some paragraphs about how we go from a phenomena in the world to an entry in the dataset.

## Data Quality Variable: Numeric_Grade
{r}
#| label: numeric_grade_dist
#| fig-cap: Distribution of Numeric Grades
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
ggplot(raw_data, aes(x = numeric_grade)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Numeric Grades", x = "Numeric Grade", y = "Frequency")


Numeric_Grade is a numeric rating given by FiveThirtyEight to indicate a pollsters quality or reliability. The rating is based on methodology, transparency and historical accuracy which is important for our analysis as we evaluate eahc poll observation. The raw data set has the following distribution with numeric grades (@numeric_grade_dist). We choose to drop all polls with numeric grades less than 3 to keep only the highest quality polls.

## Predictor Variable: State
{r}
#| label: state_dist
#| fig-cap: Distribution of Observations by State
#| echo: false
analysis_data$state[is.na(analysis_data$state)] <- "National"
state_counts <- analysis_data %>%
  count(state) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)
ggplot(state_counts, aes(x = state, y = percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Observations by State (Percentage)", x = "State", y = "Percentage") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

The state where the polling took place. This is important for state-level fixed effects, some regions show more supoprt to one party over another. Regarding the data itself, ee notice that over half of all observations are NA, in our analysis we take these to be national level polls. Since this is not explicit in the documentation [@538], this is an assumption which is a caveat in our outcome analysis. We notice in the figure (@state_dist) that not every state is represented, which limits us to the states we can make state-level predictions for.

## Predictor Variable: Party
The party variable indentifies whether the observation is for the Democratic
or Republican party. What we are interested in is the most-likely presidential candidate
so we remove any data before Kamala Harris was announced on July 21 2024, which allows us to use party as a proxy for candidate.
{r}
#| label: party_counts
#| fig-cap: Distribution of Observations by State
#| echo: false
party_counts <- analysis_data %>%
  count(party)

# Display the table
party_counts

## Predictor Variable: end_date_num
End_date is the end date of the poll and represents the informational cut off date that
the results of a poll indicate. We include this as one of the variables in our regression
in order to capture time effects such as the momentum and changing support of a candidate over time. End_date_num is the number of days since the start of the period, it increases as we approach the election period. We include it to measure the time effects, we might expect Trump's roportion to increase as end_date_num increases as we have seen historically due to shy voters @cohn_2024.

Plotting a histogram of end dates, we see how polls become much more frequent over time as the election approaches. 

{r}
#| label: end_date_history
#| fig-cap: Number of Polls over Time
#| echo: false
poll_counts <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(month = floor_date(end_date, "month")) %>%
  count(month)

# Plot the number of polls over time, by month using bars
ggplot(poll_counts, aes(x = month, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Number of Polls over Time (Monthly)", x = "Month", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

## Predictor Variable: pollster
{r}
#| label: pollster_counts
#| fig-cap: High-Grade Poll counts by Pollster
#| echo: false
pollster_counts <- analysis_data %>%
  count(pollster)

# Display the table
pollster_counts

Pollsters are the agencies that do the polls, in our datasetwe find only a few pollsters
remain as seen below. We include pollsters in our regression to account for any pollster
effects, bias can come from the pollsters themselves, or the demographics they serve. While we
do not expect this effect to be strong since we limit ourselves to the highest grade of polls
we retain this vairbale for completeness. Additionaly we notice one of the remaining pollsters
'YouGov/Center for Working Class Politics' has very few observations and we drop this because it is not well represented in the regression. The polls are from a collaboration with YouGov and a different entity [@YG_CWC] and so we see it as distinct form a YouGov poll and do not merge the two.

##Outcome Variable: pct

Pct represents percentage of support, the percentage of respondents that support each party. This is our primary outcome of interest, and will be the target of our regression. To note is that for a particular poll the sum of our pct does not add up to 100. Since we drop 
other parties, they are not represented in our data and their omission causes the sum to not be 100.

{r}
#| label: pct
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Percentage support shows us how each party's support is distributed around 46%, showcasing the close nature of the election"
# Create frequency table of pct values by party
freq_data <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(party %in% c("REP",  "DEM")) %>%
  mutate(pct_bin = cut(pct, breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 0.01))) %>%  # Bin pct into intervals of 5
  group_by(party, pct_bin) %>%
  summarise(freq = n(), .groups = 'drop')

# Generate the dodge plot for binned pct distribution by party with custom colors
ggplot(freq_data, aes(x = pct_bin, y = freq, fill = party)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Percentage Support by Party (Binned)",
       x = "Percentage Support (pct) Binned",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("REP" = "red", "DEM" = "blue")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels for readability


# Model

Our model is designed to estimate temporal trends in party support as reflected in polling percentages for the Democratic and Republican parties. We employ a Bayesian framework to capture uncertainty and provide flexibility in trend estimation over time. Based on our understanding of state-level variances @538, and possible pollster bias, we include them as variables.

## Model Set-up

The response variable \( y_i\) represents the percentage voter support for a given poll \(i\). The explanatory variables:
- \(\text{end\_date\_num}_i\): the number of days since the earliest poll date for the given party,
- \( \text{pollster}_i \): the pollster conducting the poll, and
- \( \text{state}_i \): the U.S. state where the poll was conducted (or "National" if the poll was nationwide).

For each party, we fit a separate Bayesian model with spline smoothing on \( \text{end\_date\_num}\) to capture time trends, alongside fixed effects for both pollster and state. We implement the model in R using the rstanarm package [@citeR].

The model’s hierarchical structure and notation are as follows:

\[
\begin{align}
y_i | \mu_i, \sigma &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + f(\text{end\_date\_num}_i) + \text{pollster}_i + \text{state}_i \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(50, 10) \\
f(\text{end\_date\_num}) &\sim \text{B-spline basis expansion} \\
\text{pollster}_i &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 5) \\
\text{state}_i &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 3) \\
\sigma &\sim \text{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}
\]

### Explanation of Components

- **Response variable \( y_i\)**: Observed polling percentage for each poll \( i \). This represents the percentage of voter support.

- **Mean structure \( \mu_i \)**: Consists of four components:
  
  - **Intercept \( \alpha \)**: Represents the baseline average percentage across all polls.
  
  - **Spline component \( f(\text{end\_date\_num}_i) \)**: Captures temporal trends in polling percentages over time, modeled using a B-spline basis expansion. This allows the trend to adjust flexibly over time, fitting the non-linear trends typically observed in polling data.
  
  - **Pollster effect \( \text{pollster}_i \)**: A fixed effect to account for systematic differences across pollsters. Due to varying methodologies and sampling practices, some pollsters may produce consistently higher or lower estimates.
  
  - **State effect \( \text{state}_i \)**: A fixed effect accounting for differences across states. Given the diversity in political landscapes across U.S. states, this term allows for state-specific adjustments, capturing the influence of state-level variability on polling trends. For example, large or politically heterogeneous states may exhibit unique polling behaviors that could impact results.

### Priors
- **Intercept \(\alpha \sim \text{Normal}(50, 10) \)**: Centered around 50%, allowing flexibility given historical polling percentages range from 0% to 100%.
- **Pollster effect prior \( \text{Normal}(0, 5) \)**: This moderate prior accounts for typical systematic differences by pollster, usually less than 5% on average.
- **State effect prior \( \text{Normal}(0, 3) \)**: Reflects an expected range of moderate variation across states, accounting for demographic or political differences that may influence polling results.
- **Spline basis priors**: Each spline coefficient has a Normal(0, 5) prior, allowing moderate variation in temporal trends without overfitting.
- **Error term \(\sigma \sim \text{Exponential}(1) \)**: This prior allows positive values with most mass around lower standard deviations, yet still accommodates higher values in the presence of greater noise.

### Model Implementation
The model is implemented in rstanarm using stan_glm, with spline terms on \(\text{end\_date\_num}\) and fixed effects for both pollster and state. This structure enables us to capture time trends while also adjusting for pollster and state-level variability. The Bayesian framework in rstanarm allows us to derive credible intervals around predictions, aligning with our focus on uncertainty quantification.

### Diagnostics and Validation
Model diagnostics are crucial to ensure reliability and robustness:
- **Posterior Predictive Checks**: We use pp_check functions to visually compare observed and model-predicted polling percentages. These checks help assess whether the model captures the data patterns effectively.
- **Convergence Diagnostics**: R-hat values close to 1 and trace plots are manually inspected to confirm the convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: We tested several values for the spline degrees of freedom (df = 4 was chosen) to avoid overfitting.
- **Out-of-Sample Validation**: Future work will include a test-train split for validating predictions on unseen data, using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess predictive performance.

### Alternative Models Considered
We considered the following alternatives:
1. **Non-Spline Linear Trend Model**: A simpler model assuming a linear trend in \( \text{end\_date\_num} \). However, this approach did not capture the observed non-linear trends over time.
2. **Pollster Only Model (without State Effects)**: A model without state effects was tested, but we felt that fundamentally state effects are important and should be included

The selected model—using a spline with both pollster and state fixed effects—was chosen for its ability to balance flexibility with robustness, capturing essential polling trends without excessive complexity.

### Assumptions and Limitations
This model assumes that polling trends over time follow a relatively smooth pattern and that pollster and state effects are additive and consistent over time. We note that interactions between states, their co movement with each other @538 are not included, and that this is 
a simplistic model.
